In six short years, Daniel Wellington has built a massive community of influencers and followers whose commitment and loyalty means everything. Now, we want to engage developers all over the world.

At Daniel Wellington, we use various open source projects - anything from Docker all the way to the bleeding edge.

Our brand is proof that when we collaborate with others, we can achieve more than what we set out to do. This is what we want to accomplish through sharing our work. With your help, we know that it will happen in no time at all.
